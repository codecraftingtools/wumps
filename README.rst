Wumps
=====

The goal of this project is to define a widely useful macro
programming syntax suitable for defining domain-specific languages.
The aim is to reduce the number of language keywords and built-in
constructs in favor of user-defined functions and macros.

`Wumps`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
