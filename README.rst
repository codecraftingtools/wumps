=====
Wumps
=====

The purpose of this project is to define a widely useful `macro`_ programming
syntax suitable for defining `domain-specific languages`_.  Wumps is not a
programming language in and of itself.  It is a low-level format that
provides structure for data, but does not operate on, or assign meaning to
it.  In this aspect, it is similar in function to `YAML`_, `JSON`_, or
`XML`_.  One of the main goals of Wumps is to facilitate the development of
customizable languages by eliminating most reserved keywords and built-in
constructs in favor of user-defined functions and macros.

`Wumps`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
